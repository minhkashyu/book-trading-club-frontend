# Manage a Book Trading Club

A Free Code Camp Dynamic Web Application Project. A Full Stack Javascript App using Node.js, Express.js, Passort.js, MongoDB, Vue.js 2, and Semantic UI with Google Material theme.

This is the Vue.js client side of the Fullstack App. The server side can be found at https://github.com/minhkashyu/book-trading-club-backend.

THE APP IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

NOTE: This app on heroku has a web dyno, and if the web dyno receives no traffic in a 30 minute period, the web dyno will sleep. If you access the app when the web dyno is sleeping, you will experience a short delay. After that, the web dyno will become active and the app will run normally. Also the api of the app has another web dyno, and as a result, the first data loading will have a delay as well.
